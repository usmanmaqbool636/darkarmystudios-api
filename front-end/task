- Allow user to create multiple projects (long task).
    ref Layout : https://gitlab.darkarmylabs.com/dark-army-dev-team/profitrack/-/issues/2
- Allow users to create multiple tasks on a project (related to project).
- Task can be assigned to a user and can have deadlines and due dates. 
    We want to count how many days,hours and minutes were spent on a task.
- Each task should appear on the calendar. 
    You will need to make one calender menu and implement the calendar there (done). 
    The task will appear as clickable labels on the calendar which will open the task page for that task.
- add searchable drop down top of add task button named Projects (done but not functional)
- add searchable drop down top of add task button named Users (done but not functional)
- Task should appear as a new label on calendar which can open a task pop up or slide screen and use the edit button to redirect to task edit screen/page.


<!-- functionality -->
You can borrow some functionalities from task that came with the theme --> https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-react-admin-dashboard-template/demo-1/apps/todo . Actually just use that page and link all task to a project, like a project drop down under the add task button. This will save you alot of development time. Click opening a project auto selects that project and opens the task for that project.
Also link these tasks in to the Calendar that came with theme as clickable labels --> https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-react-admin-dashboard-template/demo-1/apps/calendar . Calendar will have its own menu.
